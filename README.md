## ðŸª„ Greetings, Adventurer!
... And welcome to my corner of GitHub!

I'm Adam - a self-taught programmer, aerospace-engineer-in-training and software lead at [UoN-Racing](https://github.com/uon-fs).

The first language I learned was... [Scratch!](https://scratch.mit.edu/), but as the job market for that isn't great at the moment, I'm also proficient in C, Python, Java,
  C# and Go; and familiar with Haskell, Kotlin, Lua and [DreamBerd](https://github.com/atom-dispencer/DreamBerd)!

Currently, I spend most of my developement time writing C for [UoN-Racing](https://github.com/uon-fs) (with Go on our telemetry stack!), but I'd love to spend more time
  developing the assembler for my [iAtomSys](https://github.com/atom-dispencer/iAtomSys) project in Haskell!

### ðŸŒ± My Journey

I started learning aged 9 with the excellent book [Super Scratch Programming Adventure!](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Scratch-Programming-Adventure-Covers-Version/dp/1593274092),
  then promptly decided to try writing my own operating system in Scratch! In retrospect, it was more of a game-framework/aggregator and 10-year-old me thought it was 
  extremely successful, but it (shockingly) never worked...
  
I started on Python a few years later to write a [Text-Based Adventure Game](https://github.com/atom-dispencer/codename_TeaBAG) (or TeaBAG for short!).
  Around 2018 I began to learn Java with the goal of writing the [*greatest magic mod ever known to Minecraft!*](https://github.com/atom-dispencer/MagiksMostEvile). Suffice 
  to say, that did not happen, but dealing with 1.7.10-era [Minecraft Forge](https://github.com/minecraftforge) taught me a lot about persistence!

I worked on several Java projects over the following years, including versions of MagiksMostEvile for multiple Minecraft versions and a self-updating calculator which I wrote
  because I got bored of `V=IR` calculations doing Physics revision. I helped out making a custom compiler, assembler and package manager for a virtual-computer, then
  decided to make my own! I finished the VM and started on the compiler before I was accosted by [UoN-Racing](https://github.com/uon-fs) and have been writing C ever since...

...except for a few side projects that is! ðŸ˜‰ 
- [FireworksGL.scr](https://github.com/atom-dispencer/FireworksGL.scr) - My C firework-display screensaver is guaranteed to get some gasps from colleagues!
- [RGB Desklamp](https://gist.github.com/atom-dispencer/20dc906ab530efbbe35309a5eabbe17f) - A Micropython script for my homemade colour-changing lamp!
- [LED Wave Function Collapse](https://github.com/atom-dispencer/LEDWaveFunctionCollapse) - A Kotlin/Zig library to generate moving patterns on an LED matrix via the
  wave-function-collapse algorithm
